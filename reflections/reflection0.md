Formation of team:
I am an electrical engineer who is interested in computing. As an electrical engineer, I do not have much experience to take up computing modules in school (I’m an exchange student from Singapore). I was quite lost when asked to state my interest (in the first lesson) as I have very brief knowledge on most of the topics. I picked - Networking, Operating systems and embedded systems because they seem more interesting to me. (Again, I did not have much experience with these). 
My team was formed basically because they lacked a person and I wouldn’t mind being in any group as I was afraid that I’m not able to contribute as much as the rest. I’m really happy to be in their team now! 

First sprint:
The main objective of this sprint was to search for ideas for the project that we find interesting, and which are also within our capabilities. While searching for interesting topics in the web, as well as past project done by students, we picked 2 projects – bouncing balls and writing a terminal on Raspberry pi. We felt that both of these were feasible and we could expand and add additional features if time allows. So our next step would be to explore and go in depth to review these project and determine whether we would like to work on them for our team project. Ted had some experience and suggested that we could use openGL for some of the functions. I have no experience with openGL but I’ll explore openGL with my free time. Also, we decided that Amy should be our scrum master as she is better with organizing our work. 

Take Home work:
The tasks are not divided yet since we are still deciding (as a team) on what project to work on, but we have planned to read up on bouncing ball, openGL and creation of terminal. We decided that all of us should explore openGL, read up chapter on creating a terminal, and for me, to get my IDE up and running, so that we will have a better idea of the feasibility and the implementation of the proposed projects by the end of this week.
Overall, I felt that the sprint session was productive. It gave me a direction to look at or to start for this project. Prior to the session, I have no clue where I can start to read up on so that I can better contribute to my team. 

Concerns:
As mentioned earlier, I have little knowledge about software and sometimes I’m intimidated by the terms/topics that the class/ my team mates talked about. Fortunately, I have experience in programming in C++, and wouldn’t lack much behind in terms of programing. 
I’m keen and I look forward to learn more about software systems. I hope I can pick up catch up quickly!
